Hello there, my name is Osman and I am a Jr. Software Developer from Ankara/Turkey. I graduated from Hacettepe University Civil Engineering and I have 1.5 years of  remote working experience as an architect on fiverr on projects across many counties (mainly USA, Australia, Canada, and EU).

My software knowledge is mainly based on Microsoft Technologies such as C#, .Net Framework, MS SQL Server, EntityFramework, Asp.Net Core etc. 
I also have fundamental knowledge on front-end technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript.

Programming and Software Development first piqued my interest in C++ class, freshman year of University. After graduating and working for a while, I decided that pursuing a career in Software Development would be my best interest. To make this radical transition smoother, faster and more efficient I have enrolled in the Boost Full-stack Developer Bootcamp of BilgeAdam which is mainly focused on Microsoft Technologies such as C#, .Net Framework, MS SQL Server, EntityFramework, Asp.Net Core etc.

Besides the bootcamp education I'm also learning React.js in my spare time from Udemy and I thoroughly enjoy learning it. You can access my exercise projects from here

I am highly energetic, cheerful, well focused, team work enthusiast with strong communication skills. I would love to hear more from you and have a conversation and tell you more about my qualifications.
